## Personality

### Traits
Kainen has learned to own his strange appearance with a relaxed and veteran confidence. He often jokes that his silver horns were "kissed by a star" to put strangers at ease. Despite his chill exterior, he is constantly calculating. He views his worship of Gleti not as religious devotion but as a pragmatic trade for the power he needs. He values loyalty above all else because he has seen how easily blood ties can be severed by fear.

### Ideals
He believes the universe is composed of opposing forces like Silver and Black, or cure and curse. 

### Bonds
He carries the Zenterian Tome that swallowed his brother. It is a dangerous object that he hates, yet he guards it with his life because it is the only map to where Arkthus has gone. He made a promise to his brother through the bars of a city gate when he was eight years old. Kainen will tear reality apart if that is what it takes to keep it.

### Flaws
His desperation makes him reckless with the arcane. He is willing to meddle with ancient magic he does not fully understand if he thinks there is even a slight chance it will help him find Arkthus. Additionally, he harbors a deep and instinctive paranoia toward his own kind — he views every Tiefling he meets as a potential executioner sent from Zarith-Tor until they prove otherwise.

## Backstory

Born in the rigid Tiefling city of **Zarith-Tor**, Kainen shared an unbreakable bond with his older brother, **Arkthus**. While Kainen was born with favor, Arkthus was afflicted by "**The Black**," a curse turning him into a living shadow. When a ruthless new chief banished Arkthus, Kainen vowed to find a cure.

He turned to the worship of **Gleti, the God of Secrets**, believing that Gleti's "Silver" aspect was the metaphysical antidote to the "Black." This worship physically altered Kainen, turning his horns, eyes, and hair metallic silver — a heresy he hid while serving in the city guard until his secret was exposed, forcing him to kill a guard and flee execution.

After three years of searching the southern wilds, Kainen reunited with Arkthus, who had found an ancient **pre-Zenterian Tome** he believed contained a cure. However, the ritual described in the book went tragically wrong; instead of purging the curse, a chaotic rift opened and **swallowed Arkthus whole**, leaving no body behind.

Now a wandering mercenary, Kainen carries the tome, seeking to master the arcane arts to decipher it. He no longer hides his silver features, viewing them not as a mutation, but as a weapon and a living counter-agent to the darkness. He searches for the merchant who first taught him of Gleti, determined to learn the magic necessary to reopen the rift and pull his brother back from the void.
